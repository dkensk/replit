# Check if Workflow is on GitHub

## Quick Check

### Step 1: Verify the File is on GitHub

1. **Go to your repository:**
   - https://github.com/dkensk/replit

2. **Look for `.github` folder** in the file list
   - Scroll through the files
   - Do you see a folder called `.github`?

3. **If you see `.github`:**
   - Click on it
   - Click on `workflows` folder
   - You should see `ios-build.yml`

### Step 2: If You DON'T See `.github` Folder

The workflow file isn't on GitHub yet. We need to push it:

1. **In GitHub Desktop:**
   - Check if there are any commits to push
   - Click "Push origin" if there are

2. **Or I can help you push it** - the file exists locally, just needs to be on GitHub

## Why It's Not Showing in Actions

If the workflow file isn't on GitHub:
- GitHub Actions can't see it
- It won't show in the sidebar
- You can't run it

## Solution: Push the Workflow File

The workflow file exists locally but might not be on GitHub. Let's verify and push it if needed.
