# Where to Find Push Button in GitHub Desktop

## If You Don't See "Push origin"

This usually means you need to pull first. Here's what to look for:

## Step 1: Find the Pull Button

### Look for one of these:
- **"Pull origin"** button (usually at the top)
- **"Fetch origin"** button
- A button that says **"2 commits behind"** or similar
- A banner message at the top saying you need to pull

### Where to look:
1. **Top toolbar** - Look for buttons like "Pull", "Fetch", "Sync"
2. **Top of the window** - There might be a banner/notification
3. **Branch menu** - Click "Branch" → Look for "Pull" or "Fetch"

## Step 2: After Pulling

Once you pull:
1. The "Pull" button will disappear
2. A **"Push origin"** button should appear
3. It might show a number like "Push origin (10)" indicating commits to push

## Alternative: Use the Menu

If you can't find buttons:

1. **Click "Branch" menu** (top menu bar)
2. Look for:
   - **"Pull"** or **"Pull from origin"**
   - **"Push"** or **"Push to origin"**

## What You Should See

### Before Pull:
- Button saying "Pull" or "Fetch" or "2 commits behind"
- No "Push" button visible (because you need to pull first)

### After Pull:
- "Pull" button disappears
- **"Push origin"** button appears
- Shows number of commits to push

## Still Can't Find It?

1. **Check if you're on the right branch:**
   - Should be on `main` branch
   - Look at the top of GitHub Desktop

2. **Try the three-dot menu:**
   - Look for "..." button (usually top right)
   - Click it for more options

3. **Check the status bar:**
   - Bottom of GitHub Desktop
   - Might show sync status

## Quick Test

Can you see:
- A button that mentions "Pull" or "Fetch"?
- A button that mentions "behind" or "commits"?
- Any banner/notification at the top?

If yes, click that first! Then "Push" will appear.
