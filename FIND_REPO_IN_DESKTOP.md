# 🔍 Find Repository in GitHub Desktop

## Check Current Repository Location

1. **In GitHub Desktop**, look at the top
2. **Click on the repository name** (should show "dkensk/replit")
3. **Click "Repository" menu** → **"Show in Finder"**
4. **This will show you** where GitHub Desktop thinks the repository is

## If It's the Wrong Location

The files we changed are in:
`/Users/davidkensick/Documents/edge-hockey/Edge-Hockey`

### Option 1: Add the Correct Repository

1. **In GitHub Desktop**, click **File** → **Add Local Repository**
2. **Click "Choose..."**
3. **Navigate to:** `/Users/davidkensick/Documents/edge-hockey/Edge-Hockey`
4. **Select the folder** and click **"Add Repository"**
5. **Now you should see** all your changed files!

### Option 2: Check if Files Are Saved

Make sure the files we changed are actually saved:
- `server/index.ts`
- `client/src/lib/api.ts`
- `client/src/lib/queryClient.ts`
- `client/src/hooks/use-auth.tsx`

## Quick Check

**In GitHub Desktop:**
1. **Look at the left sidebar** - do you see "Changes" with a number?
2. **If yes**, click on "Changes" to see the files
3. **If no**, the repository might be pointing to the wrong folder

**Try adding the repository again from the correct location!**
