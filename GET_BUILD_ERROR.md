# 🔍 Get the Build Error Details

## The build is failing - I need to see the actual error

The workflow shows "exit code 1" but I need the specific error message to fix it.

## How to Find the Error:

1. **Go to your GitHub Actions:**
   - https://github.com/dkensk/replit/actions

2. **Click on the failed workflow run** (red X)

3. **Click on the "Build iOS Archive" step** (the one that failed)

4. **Scroll to the bottom of the log** and look for:
   - Lines starting with "error:"
   - Lines starting with "ERROR"
   - Any red text
   - The last 20-30 lines of output

5. **Copy the error message** and share it with me

## What to Look For:

Common errors might be:
- "No such file or directory"
- "Code signing error"
- "Missing dependency"
- "Scheme not found"
- Any error messages in red

**Share the error from the "Build iOS Archive" step and I'll fix it immediately!** 🚀
