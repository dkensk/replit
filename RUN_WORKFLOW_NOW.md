# ✅ Workflow Found - How to Run It

## What You're Seeing

You're on the workflow page: https://github.com/dkensk/replit/actions/workflows/ios-build.yml

- ✅ Workflow file is on GitHub
- ✅ "This workflow has no runs yet" - Normal! It hasn't been run yet
- ✅ Ready to run!

## How to Run It

### Step 1: Find "Run workflow" Button

On that page, look for:

1. **At the TOP RIGHT** of the page
2. **Above the "This workflow has no runs yet" message**
3. **A blue button** that says **"Run workflow"**

### Step 2: Click It

1. **Click the blue "Run workflow" button**
2. **A dropdown/popup will appear** with:
   - Branch selector (should show "main" or let you select it)
   - A green "Run workflow" button
3. **Make sure branch is set to `main`**
4. **Click the green "Run workflow" button** in the dropdown

### Step 3: Watch It Run

1. **After clicking, wait 10-20 seconds**
2. **Refresh the page** (F5 or Cmd+R)
3. **You should see a new entry** showing "Queued" or "In progress"
4. **Click on it** to see the build progress

## If You Don't See "Run workflow" Button

### Check 1: Scroll to Top
- The button is at the **very top** of the page
- Look at the **top right corner**

### Check 2: Look for Different Button Names
- Might say "Run workflow"
- Might say "Trigger workflow"
- Might be in a dropdown menu

### Check 3: Check Permissions
- Make sure you're signed in to GitHub
- Make sure you have write access to the repository

## Alternative: Trigger by Pushing Code

If you still can't find the button, we can trigger it by pushing code:

1. I'll make a small change
2. You push it via GitHub Desktop
3. This will automatically trigger the workflow

## What Happens After Running

1. **Workflow starts** (shows "Queued" then "In progress")
2. **Takes ~10-15 minutes** to build
3. **When done**, download the artifact
4. **Upload to App Store** via Transporter
