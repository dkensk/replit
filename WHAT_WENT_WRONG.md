# What Went Wrong - Issue Found

## The Problem

1. **You're on the wrong branch:**
   - Currently on: `replit-agent` branch
   - Workflow files are on: `main` branch

2. **Workflow files missing:**
   - On `replit-agent` branch: No `.github` folder
   - On `main` branch: Workflow files exist

3. **Remote status:**
   - GitHub only has 2 commits on `main`
   - Your workflow files haven't been pushed yet

## The Solution

### Step 1: Switch to Main Branch
- You need to be on `main` branch (where workflow files are)
- I'll help you switch

### Step 2: Push to GitHub
- Push your commits from `main` branch
- This will put workflow files on GitHub

### Step 3: Verify
- Check that workflows appear on GitHub
- Run the workflow

## What Happened

It looks like:
- You have multiple branches (`main` and `replit-agent`)
- The workflow setup is on `main` branch
- But you might have been working on `replit-agent` branch
- The sync/pull might have switched you to the wrong branch

Let me help you get back on track!
